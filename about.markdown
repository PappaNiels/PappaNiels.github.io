Hi! I am Niels. A game engine programmer (focussed on graphics) that is currently studying at Breda University of Applied Sciences.
<br>
<br>
In 2020, I was introduced to game development by a friend of mine, who showed me how to make scripts on cfx' platform called FiveM. He helped me set up a playground, where I could make scripts and experiment. One of those projects was recreating the Diamond Casino Heist from GTA Online, which I ended up releasing on [Github](). This was the first spark of joy in the game development scene. 
<br>
<br>
After I was done with highschool, I went to Breda University of Applied Sciences, where I am learning the cool fundaments of programming the actual game and game engine. This included me exploring all the fields within the game programming, such as graphics (where I currently focus on). Luckily, the university also provides me the opportunity to work with modern consoles, where I was fortunate enough to have worked with Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's Playstation 5, for which I have created a renderer for such platform. 
<br> 
<br> 
Currently, I am still enrolled into the university, and I am in my second year out of the four. Next to school work, I also maintain my own game engine. It is my exploration on how to create a game engine with amazing tools and to gain understanding of the field I will (hopefully) end up.
