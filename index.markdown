Hi! My name is Niels. I am a game programmer specializing in graphics and engine programming. On this website, you will find post of my work. Everything from what I have made or written about which I wanted to share. Not just school projects, but also personal work I did in my free time. Feel free to contact me to either chat about cool tech and programming. It is the one thing I love.
