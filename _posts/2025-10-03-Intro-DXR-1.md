Computer graphics is evolving rapidly. More techniques are applied, optimizations are created and we got more computational power as ever before. Everything to make the final image look as realistic as possible (or not). In 2018, Nvidia announced their new graphics card with 'special' RT cores. This meant, that shipping games with ray traced and more realistic graphics was possible, all while it was smooth and enough for gamers to enjoy those beautiful graphics.

The following articles will show my interpretation on what DXR is and how it works. After reading these articles, you would be able to create a ray tracer using DXR, and you are able to expand it with new ray tracing concepts or resources. In a later article I will also show you how you can use inline

### Vector Math
But what is ray tracing exactly? Lets start with the basics and the most scary part for a lot of people. **Math!**. Do not worry. I will try to make it as simple as possible, so a train monkey can trace rays using the math examples I will provide.

Ray tracing mainly consists of vector math. A vector consists of multiple numbers representing either a position or a direction within a coordinate system. For our case, we will have a vector of three numbers for our 3D world. Mathematicians would note a 3D vector as the following:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{pmatrix}$$

A ray consists of at least two vectors. One is for the direction the ray goes, and one for the origin. As last, a ray has a number (or lambda) that is used as the distance the ray has traveled. 

$$x = \vec{O} + \vec{D} * t$$

> Note:
> The direction of the ray needs to be normalized (magnitude needs to be 1.0) to be to make sure we do not go through and skip our geometry. We can do that by dividing the vector by the length of the vector. 

$$\vec{t}_n = \dfrac{\vec{t}}{||\vec{t}||}$$

<i>Normalizing a vector.</i>
<br>

Lets do a simple example. Lets say, we are at the coordinate (2.5, -1.0, 0.0) and we look towards (0.5, 0.5, 0.0). At a distance of 3.0, there is an object. If we use the before mentioned formula, we can calculate the location of that object.

$$x = \vec{O} + \vec{D} * t$$

$$ \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2.5 \\ -1.0 \\ 0.0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ 0.5 \\ 0.0 \end{pmatrix} \times 3.0 $$

$$ = \begin{pmatrix} 2.5 \\ -1.0 \\ 0.0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 1.5 \\ 1.5 \\ 0.0 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$ = \begin{pmatrix} 4.0 \\ 0.5 \\ 0.0 \end{pmatrix} $$

Now we know where the object is in the world ((4.0, 0.5, 0.0) in this case) and we can do more calculations based on that position (e.g. lighting, shadows, reflections, ...). If we take that to C/C++ code it would look like this:

```cpp
struct Ray
{
    float3 Origin;      // O
    float3 Direction;   // D
    float  Distance;    // t
};

float3 GetWorldPosition(const Ray& ray)
{
    return ray.Origin + ray.Direction * ray.Distance;
}
```

### Ray Generation
The creation, or so called 'generation' of the rays is very simple. A ray gets generated by having the camera's position as the origin and the direction that goes through a pixel of the render target. This can be one or more, if that is desired. 

This can be done as seen below in pseudo code (HLSL equivalent by Microsoft in their [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/blob/master/Samples/Desktop/D3D12Raytracing/src/D3D12RaytracingSimpleLighting/Raytracing.hlsl#L79-L93)). This takes the projection into account, so the user can change it easily by just changing the matrices.

```cpp
Ray GetPrimaryRay(const float3& cameraPosition, uint2 index, const float4x4& inverseVP) 
{
    Ray ray = {};
    ray.Origin = cameraPosition;

    // Set the position on the middle of the pixel
    float2 screenPos = float2(index) + float2(0.5f);

    // Transform from [0..ScreenDimension] to [0..1]
    screenPos = screenPos / RenderTargetDimensions;

    // Transform from [0..1] to [-1..1]
    screenPos = screenPos * 2.0f - 1.0f;

    // Depending on the graphics API. For DXR, it is needed...
    screenPos.y = 1.0f - screenPos.y; 

    // Transform from clip to world space
    float4 world = inverseVP * float4(screenPos, 0.0f, 1.0f);

    // Perspective divide
    world.xyz / world.z;

    // Create ray direction
    ray.Direction = normalize(world.xyz - cameraPosition);

    return ray;
}
```

### Ray Intersection

So we know where our camera is in the scene, the direction and where an object is with all its properties. But we are missing one key aspect. We do not know what the closest object is to the camera that the ray intersects with. That is where the intersection functions come into play. These functions calculate if the ray intersects with the object and at what distance. Lets start with a simple intersection function. The one from a sphere.

$$\text{$r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2,\:$ where $\:r^2 < x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \:$ is inside of the sphere}$$

After rewriting the function to something more useful for us (what Peter Shirley did in [Ray tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#addingasphere/ray-sphereintersection)), you would get a mathematical function that looks like this:

$$D\cdot D \times t^2 - 2 \times t \times D \cdot (C - O) + (C - O) \cdot (C - O) - r^2 = 0$$

$$D$$ is the ray direction, $$O$$ is the ray origin, $$C$$ is the center of the sphere and $$r$$ is the radius of the sphere. The only variable that is unknown and is what we are solving for is $$t$$ (the ray distance). After filling the parameters inside of this function, it looks like a quadratic equation, which can easily be solved using the so called 'quadratic formula'.

$$\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 \times a \times c}}{2 \times a}$$

Lets look at the discriminant of the quadratic equation. Because there is a possibility of early out there where we can save some resources. If the discriminant is less than zero, then the ray missed the sphere entirely, making solving for $$t$$ unnecessary. If the discriminant is zero or greater than zero, we have a hit and we can proceed doing all the calculations needed to solve for $$t$$. Since we want the closest object to the origin, we only solve for $$t$$ using the minus version of the quadratic formula.

So this is ray tracing in a nutshell. We create rays from the camera, we trace them, test them against objects and return the colour closest object to the camera to create a render target, which we present to the screen.
